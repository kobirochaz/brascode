A simple site code using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

I decided to show you all my progress, so this is not exactly a project, but a simple exercise from one of my studies.

I changed the green color of the original code to gray to provide the user with a better visual experience. It's important to think about choosing colors for a website as part of accessibility policies because many people are sensitive to bright colors.

Since this is a simple website code and just an exercise, the choice of colors needs to be accurate, as there are not several themes available for the user to choose the best one. Normally, when only the "light" and "dark" options are available, most users opt for the dark theme, but we can work on more suitable light themes for a 100% satisfactory experience.

The original code belongs to Fundação Bradesco.
